Event Bubbling: 
=============

<body>
    <div>
        <span>
            <button>Click Me</button>
        </span>
    </div>
</body>



=> When the user clicks on the button, not only the button called, even its parent tags called.
=> It follows bottom up approach, when the button is clicked, then the span called , then div, then body, then html called.


stopPropagation():
=================

It interupts the event Bubbling, excluding that event, later next tags are stopped.
