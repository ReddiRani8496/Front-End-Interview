Rest Operator:
-------------

A rest operator is a type of parameter that gets all of the remaining parameters of a function call via an Array. It enables us to handle a variety of inputs as parameters in a function. 
Because it is used to combine many items, the rest operator is very helpful during array and object destructuring.

Example:
-------
const colors = ["red", "green", "yellow", "blue"];
let [color1, ...rest] = colors;




Spread Operator:
---------------

The spread operator divides an array or object into separate elements or properties. 
The spread operator is mostly used if you want to duplicate the content of an array or combine or combine multiple arrays/objects together.

Example: 
--------
const firstArray = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30];
const newArray=[...firstArray, 35, 40]
