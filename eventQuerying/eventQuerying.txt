Event Querying:
===============

    Event querying is same as the event bubbling. But it follows the top to bottom approach.


<body>
    <div>
        <span>
            <button>Click Me</button>
        </span>
    </div>
</body>


=> when button is clicked from top to bottom.
=> html, body, div, span, button is executed.
