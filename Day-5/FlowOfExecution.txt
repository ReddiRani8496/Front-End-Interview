Execution Context:

var n = 2;
function square(num) {
    let square = num * num;
    return square
}
let square2 = square(n);

let square4 = square(4);


Execution Context is divided into two parts Memory and code.

Memory contains the variables.
code contains the function Execution.

so in Memory first n is stored, then square{} is stored, square2, square4 is stored and
default values of n, square2, square4 are undefined.

next the value of n is assigned to 2.

next the square function is called with argument 2, so this function is executed
in the code area. Code area is again divided into two parts Memory and code.

in Memory num is stored with default undefined value.
in code, num * num is executed and returns 4 to square variable.
in square2 variable is stored with returned value i.e., 4.
